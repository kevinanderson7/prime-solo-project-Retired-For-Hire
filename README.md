## Solo Project: Retired For Hire

Heroku link: https://retired-for-hire.herokuapp.com/#/home

While studying psychology at UMKC, I identified a need for a platform to help combat depression that surfaces post-retirement for some individuals due to lack of engagement in the community, while also providing an avenue for retired individuals to market their skills for additional income.
The app allows private parties to hire highly skilled individuals that are post-retirement by looking through services entered by the post-retirement users.
I created it using React to build out the front end, Node.js/ Express for the server, PostgreSQL for the database, and a REST-style architecture.
The technology used: React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Material-UI
